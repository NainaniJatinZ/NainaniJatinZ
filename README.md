# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jatin!

**Explorer first, researcher second, engineer third.**

Iâ€™m deeply fascinated by **intelligence and reasoning**, both in narrow and general contexts. My core interests lie in reverse-engineering systems like **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **diffusion models**, particularly exploring their non-trivial capabilities.

Currently, Iâ€™m pursuing an **MS in Computer Science** at **UMass Amherst**, working on my thesis in **Mechanistic Interpretability** under the guidance of **Prof. David Jensen** and **Prof. Anna Green** *(Preliminary report coming soon!)*.
